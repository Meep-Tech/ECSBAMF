XBAM (or XBAMF) is short for E.C.S.B.A.M.F, which stands for: "Entity Component System Based Archetype Model Factories". XBam is a framework for managing Flyweight combined with Factory patterns for use in things like game dev, modable development, and static data management.

XBAM allows one to create complex branching trees of both [[Archetype]]s and [[Model]]s in order to manage things such as Item Types for a game or Command Types for a Scripting Language, while being able to also control how extensible each Archetype or Model within your application is.

The main components of XBAM are:
- [[Concepts/Enumeration|Enumerations]]
- [[Archetype]]s
- [[Model]]s
- And [[Component]]s
