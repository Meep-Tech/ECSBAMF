Factories are classes that inherit from [[IFactory]]; Usually [[Archetype]]s. It is rare for a Factory in [[XBam]] to not be an Archetype. 
The purpose of a [[Factory]] is to produce a [[Model]] using a [[Builder]] or [[Parameter]]s.

Factories in XBam use [[Make Function]]s to produce new Models using either a Builder or collection of Parameters.
